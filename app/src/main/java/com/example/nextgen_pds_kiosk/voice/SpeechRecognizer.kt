// This file is intentionally replaced.
// Speech recognition is now handled entirely by VoiceManager.kt
// using Android's built-in android.speech.SpeechRecognizer API.
// The Vosk offline library (which this file previously depended on) has been
// removed because it is not compatible with Android 16KB page-size devices.
